### Provided Files
README   link to project page and info about other files
Makefile used by make to build a shared object file needed for testing
p3Heap.h header file with the signatures for public "shared" functions
p3Heap.c source code with functions that must be completed

### To build p3Heap object file:
EDIT     vim p3Heap.c (complete functions where indicated by TODO tags)
COMPILE  make         (this will build p3Heap.o and libheap.so)

### To test your heap functions:
cd tests              (change to the tests sub-directory)
make                  (compiles all tests and runs test_align1)
make partA            (runs the tests that only require alloc works)
make partB            (runs the tests that require alloc and free)
make partC            (runs the tests that require alloc, free with immediate coalescing)

### Write your own tests to help your incremental development
You may edit the tests given, but it is probably best to copy
each test to a new file and edit your own tests so that you 
can keep all tests as they have been provided.

### We will grade based on these tests and others we do not provide
